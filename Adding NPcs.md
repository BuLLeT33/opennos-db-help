### Adding an NPC
First of all you need to open your Database and head over to the Table **MapNPC**
Here you will create an NPC. You can either edit an _existing one_ or create a **new one**. We will create a **new one** in this tutorial.

The first column **MapNpcID** is to set the ID of your NPC. Just be sure there are no double ID's because if there are you will get an error when saving the new NPC. If it says Identity Inser set to off then let the column empty and it will be created automatically.

Next column is gonna be **Dialog** (_important_)
